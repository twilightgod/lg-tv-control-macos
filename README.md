# LG TV Control for macOS

Automatically wake/sleep and change the input of your LG TV when used as a monitor on macOS.

This script uses Hammerspoon to detect system events such as power off, sleep, and wake.

It makes use of [`bscpylgtv`](https://github.com/chros73/bscpylgtv) to control the TV set. It is included in this repository for Apple Silicon but can easily be compiled for Intel if desired.

## Pro Tips

- For the best result, make sure you configure your TV for PC use. [This video](https://youtu.be/zv-2yP7Rumo?si=vlrtGhWwUl8aSjnt) is a great place to start.
- Make sure Wake on LAN is enabled in your TV settings. Settings > Support > IP Control Settings > Wake on LAN = ENABLED.

## Pre-installation Requirements

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

## Installation

Use the installation script for a simple and convenient installation process.

Before proceeding, make sure you have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed.

Run the following commands in Terminal:

```bash
cd /tmp
git clone https://github.com/cmer/lg-tv-control-macos.git
cd lg-tv-control-macos
./install.sh
```

### Configuration
Change the HDMI input at the top of `~/.hammerspoon/lgtv.lua` script, if needed. Optionally, set `debug` to `true` if you are running into issues.


## Legacy version using LGWebOSRemote

This new and updated version no longer uses LGWebOSRemote, and does not require installing Python. It is therefore much easier to get going. ðŸŽ‰
